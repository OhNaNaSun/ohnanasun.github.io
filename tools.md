### [babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/)
Babel is a JavaScript compiler
Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Here are the main things Babel can do for you:

* Transform syntax
* Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (through @babel/polyfill)
* Source code transformations (codemods)
* And more! (check out these videos for inspiration)
